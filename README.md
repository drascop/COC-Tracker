# Clash of Clans Tracker

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack web application built with **Spring Boot** (backend) and **Angular** (frontend). It allows users to enter a **Clash of Clans player ID**, queries the **Clash of Clans API**, and displays the playerâ€™s profile if it exists.

## Why I Started This Project
- I wanted to **further practice my skills** in **Spring Boot** and **Angular**.
- Eventually, I plan to use this project to **learn and practice CI/CD workflows**, including **GitHub Actions** and **Docker**.

## Key Features
- User enters a **Clash of Clans player ID** on the homepage.
- The backend fetches **player profile data** from the official **Clash of Clans API**.
- The frontend displays **player stats, trophies, and clan info**.
- Future enhancements may include **storing player history** or **tracking progress over time**.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Java, WebClient for API calls
- **Database:** None (currently fetching data directly from API)
- **Tools:** Docker (future use), GitHub Actions (future use)

## Future Plans
- Implement **CI/CD workflows** using **GitHub Actions**.
- Learn **Docker** and create simple Docker images for deployment.
- Explore adding **user authentication** and **player tracking**.
